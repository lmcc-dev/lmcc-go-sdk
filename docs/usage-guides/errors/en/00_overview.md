## Overview

The `pkg/errors` module provides a powerful and structured approach to error handling in Go applications. It extends the standard library with:

- **Automatic stack traces** for easier debugging
- **Error codes** for programmatic error handling
- **Rich error context** through wrapping
- **Error aggregation** for collecting multiple failures
- **Standard library compatibility** with `errors.Is`, `errors.As`
